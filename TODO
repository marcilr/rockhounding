Wed 08 Jun 2022 10:39:13 PM AKDT - Today Shena asked me to pull all 
  my rocks out of the rock shed for cleanup and sale.  I pulled out
  approximately 30 odd boxes from my rock shed.  Boxes of my original
  rock collection labeled from Maine, boxes labeled Alaska, and large
  specimens from Alaska.  Now need to sort, organize, and determine
  subseqent processing.
